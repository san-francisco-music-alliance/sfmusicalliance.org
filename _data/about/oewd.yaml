    bio: >
      2012, Ben Van Houten became San Francisco’s first nighttime economy manager, a position created
      after an economic impact study identified the $4.2 billion generated annually by San Francisco’s nightlife
      and entertainment industry. Ben is involved in a wide range of policy efforts to support the industry,
      with accomplishments including: leading a groundbreaking regional initiative to improve all-night
      transportation; developing legislation to create San Francisco’s first new full liquor licenses in over 70
      years; working to foster compatibility between entertainment venues and residential developments;
      and guiding capacity-building efforts to support the local music industry. Ben is the co-founder of San
      Francisco music nonprofit The Bay Bridged, and has helped to produce and program a wide variety of
      music festivals and concerts over the past decade.
