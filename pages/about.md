The Primary Goal of the SFMA is to coordinate the SF Music Industry to identify and pursue
collaborative projects that help ensure the vibrancy, success, and sustainability of the San
Francisco music community.

The San Francisco Music Alliance will engage in a variety of outreach and educational activities
throughout the entire city. SFMA will be led by an Advisory Council representing artists, the
music industry, community organizations, the San Francisco Entertainment Commission and the
Mayor’s Office of Economic and Workforce Development. The SFMA will support the diverse array of small businesses, nonprofit, and creative groups that contribute significantly to the vibrancy of San Francisco’s various community corridors.
