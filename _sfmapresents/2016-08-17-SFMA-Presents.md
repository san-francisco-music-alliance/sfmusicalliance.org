Over 100 local businesses helped us debut Playlist. Check back tomorrow for the full list of partners. You can also find the playlist online each month via Spotify, Amazon, Pandora, Apple, Google, Deezer and OneTune. Thanks to Deli Magazine, SF Gate, SF Weekly, Do The Day and KQED Pop Blog who all had nice things to say about the initiative with great write-ups today.

Oh and you can listen here right now!!
