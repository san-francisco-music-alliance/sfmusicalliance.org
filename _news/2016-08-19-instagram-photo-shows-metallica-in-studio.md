It’s hard to believe that Metallica hasn’t given us a new album since 2008’s stellar throwback, Death Magnetic. Sure, the band’s been busy doing all-request shows, spots on late night television, all the while readying some wicked live albums, but come on fellas, we’ve been waiting!

Anyways, a photo recently surfaced upon Metallica’s official Instagram account, in which bassist Robert Trujillo can be seen with his rhythmic axe in hand, sitting in front of a studio console. Meanwhile, the photographer’s fingers creep into the shot and form the horns. We’re going to guess that the fingers belong to Lars.

“Rockin along” is the caption we see accompanying the photo, so combining that with the previous information, leads us to believe a new Metallica album (which would be their tenth!) is in the works. Oh, and it helps that Trujillo recently confirmed that in an interview with The Pulse of Radio:

_“We’re having a really amazing time,” he said. “It’s fun, it’s a lot of hard work, it’s like you’re looking at that mountain of ideas and you’re like, ‘Okay, it’s time to climb this beast and do what we’ve got to do.’ I’d say we’ve pretty much exhausted our touring cycles, so we’re really, really excited about nurturing the songs and bringing them to life and that’s where we’re at right now.”
